## My process
I first had to set up the HTML with divs so I can easily section each of the info in the card. Then, I used flexbox for the card so I can add gapping and equal spacing. For the currency and 'days left' part, I used a flexbox so I can add a space-between to make them separate. Next step was to add the hover effect. Finally, I had to add mobile responsiveness to make it, well, responsive in mobile!
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable in writing cleaner code and having a good idea of what color should go with what.
